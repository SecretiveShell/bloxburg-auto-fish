# bloxburg-auto-fish

This is my program for automatically fishing in bloxburg. It runs on python3 and requires you to install the following dependencies.
|library|command|
|---|---|
|[opencv](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)|`pip install opencv-python`|
|[pynput](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/)|`pip install pynput`|
|[mss](https://pypi.org/project/mss/)|`pip install mss`|

Please understand that the pre-built opencv bindings do not support GPU acceleration so if you have a NVIDEA/AMD GPU you should compile the binary from source.
